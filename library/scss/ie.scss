// ******************************************************************
//	Stylesheet: IE Stylesheet
//	Supporting IE8 and above
// ******************************************************************/

// Imports & Dependencies
// Remember, all the BASE styles are called already since IE can
// read those. Below, we need to import only the stuff IE can't
// understand (what's inside the media queries). We also need to
// import the mixins file so SASS can understand the variables.

@import "partials/variables"; // import variables
@import "partials/mixins"; // import mixins
@import "partials/typography"; // import typography

// Additional IE Fixes
// These fixes are now ONLY seen by IE, so you don't have to worry
// about using prefixes, although it's best practice. For more info
// on using Modernizr classes, check out this link:
